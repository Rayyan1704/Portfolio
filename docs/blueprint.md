## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark mode with #0A0A0A for a cinematic feel; light mode with clean white. Color is based on an association of modern tech aesthetic and stark functionalism.
- Primary color: Saturated purple (#9400D3) for neon accents and glowing effects in dark mode. The color should appear as a highlight atop a dark background. In light mode: Metallic silver glow.
- Accent color: A slightly lighter violet, (#C77DFF) also a good complement to the background. Should be noticeably different than primary to create contrast and visual interest. In light mode, apply it very sparingly.
- Body text font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for clean and readable content.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headers, conveying a futuristic look. Satoshi could be a good alternative.
- Use Lucide Icons for a consistent and modern icon set.
- Employ a responsive multi-page layout with smooth scroll animations and a visually premium design inspired by Netflix, Apple, and OpenAI.
- Integrate Framer Motion for smooth animations, hover depth, magnetic cursor effects, and page load hero animations.
