    "Hi, I’m Mohammed Aaqil Rayyan from India. I’m passionate about building AI systems that genuinely help people in their daily lives.My goal is to build AI that supports human strengths rather than replacing them. I don’t want to create a world where machines make people lazy.",
    "I dream of contributing to society through purposeful innovation. I want to design AI that solves real problems without taking away the value of effort and learning. My focus is on developing tools that reduce unnecessary barriers, improve understanding, and support people in doing what they do best — thinking, creating and growing.",
    "I’m aiming to become a top AI engineer and researcher, working on projects that create positive change on a global scale. I’m constantly learning, experimenting and improving, driven by the belief that AI can make the world not just more advanced, but more meaningful. My goal is to shape a future where technology empowers humanity, not the other way around."
